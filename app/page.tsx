        <div className="space-y-6 text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            Many people ask, “Is it too late to start coding at 30?”
            While the number 30 is common in search queries, the underlying concern
            applies to 28, 32, 35, or beyond. The real question is not the specific age,
            but whether enough structured time exists to build meaningful skill.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">
            Coding Is Measured in Hours, Not Age
          </h3>

          <p>
            Reaching a job-ready coding level typically requires approximately
            <strong> 800 focused hours</strong>. This represents structured exposure
            to programming fundamentals, problem-solving, and project implementation.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you study:
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>4 hours per day → about 200 days</li>
            <li>2 hours per day → about 400 days</li>
            <li>1 hour per day → about 800 days</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The controlling variable is daily time allocation, not chronological age.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Delay Cost Perspective</h3>
          <p>
            Delaying structured learning by five years represents measurable opportunity cost.
            Even 2 hours per day equals roughly 3,650 hours over five years.

          <p>
            Many individuals worry that starting investing at 35 is late.
            The concern usually stems from hearing about compounding from age 20.
            However, investing is governed by time horizon and consistency —
            not simply the starting number.

            Foundational Investing Requires Structured Learning

          <p>
            Foundational investing literacy typically requires approximately
            <strong>400 focused hours</strong>. This includes understanding:
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Risk and volatility</li>

            <li>Long-term compounding behavior</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            At 1 hour per day, 400 hours can be accumulated in just over one year.

            Compounding Still Works at 35

          <p>
            Starting at 35 often still leaves 25–30 working years ahead.
            Compounding over multiple decades remains powerful.
            The delay question is about lost accumulation years, not impossibility.

          <p>
            Starting gym at 40 often raises questions about recovery,
            adaptation, and long-term results. However, physical adaptation
            continues throughout adulthood.

            Noticeable body recomposition typically requires
            <strong> 500 structured training hours</strong>.
          </p>

          <p>
            At 3 hours per week, that equals roughly 3–4 years of consistent training.

            but adaptation remains possible. The determining variable

          </p>

          <p>
            At 3 hours per day, that equals roughly one year.

          Frequently Asked Questions
        </h2>

        <div className="space-y-6 text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">

          <h3 className="font-semibold">Is age the main limitation?</h3>
          <p>
            No. The primary variable in structured modeling is available daily hours and long-term consistency.
          </p>

          <h3 className="font-semibold">What if I only have 1 hour per day?</h3>
          <p>
            Even 1 hour per day accumulates 365 hours annually. Over multiple years,
            this becomes significant.
          </p>

          <h3 className="font-semibold">What happens if I delay five years?</h3>
          <p>
            A five-year delay represents lost accumulation time. The required hours
            remain constant; only the starting point shifts.
          </p>

          <h3 className="font-semibold">How much time do we spend sleeping in a lifetime?</h3>
          <p>
            At 8 hours per day, approximately one-third of life is spent sleeping.
            The calculator models projected sleep allocation based on your inputs.
          </p>

          <h3 className="font-semibold">Can reducing screen time accelerate skill development?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes. Reallocating even one hour per day increases annual investment time by 365 hours.
